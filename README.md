# A Multiple Linear Regression Model Analysis on Abalone Age Prediction 

## Abstract

This project focused on analyzing the relationship between abalone age and other physical measurements. By employing the least squares method and stepwise procedures, several reasonable models were built. Through internal validation and external validation, the best model was chosen. After detecting and depleting influential outliers from the whole dataset, the final model was fitted on the remaining dataset which will be used to accurately predict the age of abalone. All technical details for building the model are presented. The whole analysis is rigorous and integral. In addition, other dimension reduction methods, including Principal Component Regression(PCR) and shrinkage methods, were implemented and their results were compared.
